    "  and wings, and other solid bodies of often complicated shapes.\n",
    "- Finite element modeling is also often used to describe the generation and\n",
    "  propagation of earthquake waves. In these cases, one needs to accurately\n",

In the concrete application, we were interested in describing flow in the Earth mantle under the [East African Rift](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_African_rift), a zone where two continental plates drift apart.
